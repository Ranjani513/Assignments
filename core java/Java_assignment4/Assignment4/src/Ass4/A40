A)We generally get syntax  error,runtime error and logic errors.
Errors can be handled in java.
We have Checked Exceptions which means we can handle the errors  at the complietime and Unchecked Exceptions which 
occured at the Runtime.We can handle both runtime and complietime exceptions using following keywords like try,catch,throw,
throws,finally.
